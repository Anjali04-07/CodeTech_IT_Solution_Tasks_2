This project demonstrates an Automated Report Generation System developed using Python, designed to read structured data from a file, analyze it, and generate a well-formatted PDF report automatically. The main objective of this project is to eliminate manual report creation and provide a reliable, reusable solution for generating professional reports in a programmatic way.

The script uses the Pandas library for data handling and analysis. Data is first created and stored in a CSV file, simulating real-world datasets such as student scores, sales data, or performance metrics. Pandas is then used to load the data and compute meaningful statistics including the average, highest, and lowest values. This analytical step ensures that the generated report contains both raw data and useful insights.

For PDF generation, the project utilizes the ReportLab library, which is a powerful and industry-standard tool for creating PDF documents in Python. The report is structured with a clear title, a summary section displaying computed statistics, and a detailed table presenting the full dataset. Proper formatting such as headings, spacing, table borders, text alignment, and background colors is applied to enhance readability and professionalism.

The project is modular, easy to understand, and beginner-friendly, making it suitable for academic use, internships, and practical learning of Python automation. It can be easily extended to work with larger datasets, Excel files, or real-time data sources, and additional features such as charts or multiple report pages can be added.

Overall, this project showcases practical skills in file handling, data analysis, automation, and PDF report generation, making it a valuable addition to any Python developer’s portfolio.
